# ForecasringSales
Goal: Analyzing sales data and predicting future sales trends

As a data analyst at Razavi Bread Co., I was tasked with analyzing the company's sales and customer data to forecast demand and predict future sales volumes in their online store. I began by inspecting and cleaning the dataset, which contained information on sales volume, customers, product types and names, expiration dates, average ratings, and promotional information. I then performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify any trends or patterns in the data that could help inform your forecasting models.

After completing my EDA, I trained several time series forecasting models using Python and scikit-learn. I started with a basic ARIMA model and then experimented with other models such as Prophet and XGBoost to improve my predictions. I evaluated the performance of each model using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).

Finally, I used the best-performing model to generate predictions for future sales volumes in the online store. I presented my findings to the company's management team and recommended strategies for optimizing inventory and improving sales.
